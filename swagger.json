    "description" : "Production resource management shall be defined as the collection of activities that manage the information about resources required by production operations, and relationships between resources. The resources include machines, tools, labour (with specific skill sets), materials and energy, as defined in the object models given in ISA-95 Part 1. Direct control of these resources in order to meet production requirements is performed in other activities, such as production dispatching and production execution management. Management of information about segments of production is also an activity in resource management. Management of the resource information may be handled by computer systems but it may be partly or entirely handled by manual processes. Management of the resources may include local resource reservation systems to manage information about future availability. There may be separate reservation systems for each ANSI/ISA-95.00.03-2013 - 28 - managed critical resource. There may be separate activities for each type of resource, or combined activities for sets of resources.  Information about resources and relationships between resources needed for a segment of production must be maintained and provided on the available, committed and unattainable capacity for specific periods of time of specified resources as defined in ISA-95 Part 1.",
